# 🧬 DNA-Based Encryption System

## 🔍 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview  
**DNA-Based Encryption** is a cryptographic method that translates regular text into DNA sequences (A, T, C, G).  
It applies *mutations* to enhance security and then decodes it back to readable text.  
Yes — encryption with biology. Sounds cool, right?

### 1.2 Objectives  
- 🔐 Develop a secure encryption system using principles inspired by biological DNA.  
- 🧪 Implement mutation-based obfuscation to increase complexity and security.  
- 🛠️ Provide a structured encryption-decryption workflow for robust data handling.

### 1.3 Scope  
- 🔡 Encrypt plain text messages into DNA sequences.  
- 🧬 Apply random mutations to make data harder to decode.  
- 🔓 Decrypt mutated DNA sequences back into readable text.  
> ⚠️ Focused only on basic message encryption & decryption using DNA logic.

## ⚙️ 3. Algorithm & Implementation

### 3.1 Encoding Algorithm  
> *(Add your step-by-step explanation here once finalized)*  
E.g.:
- Map each character to binary
- Map binary to DNA bases (2-bit = 1 base)
- Store sequence

## ✅ 4. Testing & Validation

### 4.1 Test Cases  
- 🧪 Encrypt simple messages and check the output.  
- 🔁 Simulate mutations and validate decryption accuracy.  
- 🔢 Test across different string lengths & mutation levels.

### 4.2 Edge Cases  
- 🚨 **Extreme Mutations:** Can the system still recover?  
- 🔣 **Special Characters:** How are non-letters handled?

## 🛡️ 5. Advantages & Security Analysis

### 5.1 Why DNA Encryption?  
- 🧠 Unique biological encryption model  
- 🧬 Mutation complexity ≈ stronger security  
- ⚡ Lightweight & efficient computation  
- 🔐 Difficult to reverse without the correct decryption key

### 5.2 Security Considerations  
- 🎲 Mutation randomness = extra layer of protection  
- 🔍 Brute-force attacks become impractical  
- 🧩 Even with partial data, decoding is non-trivial
