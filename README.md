#  DNA-Based Encryption System

**DNA-Based Encryption** is a cryptographic method that translates regular text into DNA sequences (A, T, C, G).  
It applies *mutations* to enhance security and then decodes it back to readable text.  
Yes — encryption with biology. Sounds cool, right?

### Objectives  
-  Develop a secure encryption system using principles inspired by biological DNA.  
-  Implement mutation-based obfuscation to increase complexity and security.  
-  Provide a structured encryption-decryption workflow for robust data handling.

### Scope  
-  Encrypt plain text messages into DNA sequences.  
-  Apply random mutations to make data harder to decode.  
-  Decrypt mutated DNA sequences back into readable text.  
>  Focused only on basic message encryption & decryption using DNA logic.

###  Why DNA Encryption?  
-  Unique biological encryption model  
-  Mutation complexity ≈ stronger security  
-  Lightweight & efficient computation  
-  Difficult to reverse without the correct decryption key

### Security Considerations  
- Mutation randomness = extra layer of protection  
- Brute-force attacks become impractical  
- Even with partial data, decoding is non-trivial
