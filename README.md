DNA-Based Encryption System
1.Introduction

1.1 Overview
DNA-Based Encryption is kinda  cryptographic method that converts text into DNA sequences (A, T, C, G) for encoding, applies mutations for added security, and allows decryption back to text. Sounds cool
1.2 Objectives
Develop a secure encryption system using biological DNA principles.
Implement mutation-based obfuscation for increased security.
 Provide a structured encryption-decryption workflow for robust data handling.
1.3 Scope
Encrypt text messages into DNA sequences.
Apply random mutations to make the data harder to decode.
Decrypt mutated DNA sequences back into readable text.
Only this.

4️. Testing & Validation

4.1 Test Cases
Encrypt a simple message and validate output.
Simulate mutation effects and ensure successful decryption.
Test with different string lengths & mutation levels.
4.2 Edge Cases Considered
Extreme mutations – Can the system still decode?
Special characters – How are non-alphabet characters handled?


5️. Advantages & Security Analysis

5.1 What is the point here?
Unique biological-inspired encryption model.
Mutation complexity makes brute-force attacks harder.
Efficient encoding & lightweight computation.
Hard to reverse-engineer without the decryption key.
5.2 Security Considerations
Mutation randomness adds a layer of security.
Hard to reverse-engineer without the decryption key.
